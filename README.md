- 👋 Hi, I’m @cfew
- 👀 I’m interested in pentesting and cyber threat analysis, with a side-pursuit of web development for a well-rounded knowledge base that could lead to opportunities in application security, DevSecOps, and information security engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning enumeration, scripting, Python, and HTML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any relevant projects and platforms that will help solidify and expand my knowledge and skillset
- 📫 How to reach me ...
